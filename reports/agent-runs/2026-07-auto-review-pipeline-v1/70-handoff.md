- Current workflow: DRAFT-2 human dispatch; target auto pipeline disabled for
  this bootstrap stage

## Tests / Checks

- Harness implementation tests: not run; no implementation exists.
- Intake JSON, stage branch, imported-scope and validator checkpoint checks:
  see `60-test-output.txt`.
- Stage-design checks: PASS (JSON, checkpoint validator, required artifacts,
  diff whitespace, D1–D12/P1–P13 traceability, product-path isolation, locked
  vocabulary).

## Stage Design Disposition

`00-task.md`, `10-design.md`, and `11-adr.md` freeze:

1. versioned authorization/status/receipt shapes;
2. dispatch-mode and runner-state transition matrix;
3. call/wall-clock/single-rework-ledger accounting;
4. serial/parallel review units and provider isolation;
5. seen-diff byte bind and two-commit seal protocol;
6. verdict parsing, multi-owner routing, evidence paths, and threat boundary;
7. bootstrap routing: serial Claude-GLM implementation packages and Kimi
   review-1 under current human dispatch.

## Independent Stage-Design Review

- Fable5: `13-stage-design-review-fable5.md` — `ACCEPT-with-edits`
- Fix record: `14-stage-design-review-fix.md`
- Record patches applied:
  1. restored mandatory post-cross-check blocking pass and froze evidence-free
     blocking inputs;
  2. added P11 pilot metrics/default-flip evidence contract;
  3. corrected complexity evaluator authority source to workflow rotation;
  4. defined/tested nullable `expires_at` semantics.
- Frozen operator decisions reopened: none
- Implementation authorized: no

## Open Findings / Breakdown Items

1. Development breakdown must assign mutually safe file packages, dependencies,
   exact commands, and review focus.
2. Before final review, operator must resolve review-2 routing. OpenAI/Codex and
   Anthropic/Claude both have prior direction/design involvement; neither may be
   recorded as `none`.
3. Future pilot stages choose positive call-count/wall-clock values in their
   human authorization; no global numeric defaults are part of this stage.

## Blockers

- None for stage design.
- Implementation/model dispatch is not yet authorized.

## 下一步

Claude Fable 5, or Opus4.8 after documented Fable quota exhaustion, produces
`12-development-breakdown.md`. It must preserve the frozen file boundary and
serial bootstrap routing. Only after breakdown and human-executed dispatch
packets are complete may implementation be considered; this handoff does not
authorize it.

下一步任务: 只起草 `12-development-breakdown.md`，冻结 owner/file/test/review 边界；不得实现或执行模型 dispatch。
