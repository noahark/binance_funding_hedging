# Handoff

## Recovery Header

- Active phase: `implementation / Task A embedded-review repair`
- Next action: human operator dispatches the scope-contained GLM Task A repair, then a fresh Kimi round-2 embedded review.
- Read-set: `status.current_inputs`
- Open blockers: Task A round-1 embedded review returned a scope-contained BLOCKER; Task B retry review is PASS.
- Do-not-read: `reports/agent-runs/**/history/**`, other stages

## Current State

- Stage: `2026-07-real-borrow-execution-v1`
- Status: `implementing` (Task A repairing four round-1 findings; Task B ready for R4 reconciliation)
- Branch: `stage/2026-07-real-borrow-execution-v1`
- Last committed design baseline: `8ffc81b21154bdf8a6255ae68cba936fbed12a99`
- H_intake dispatch evidence commit: `90e66c3f9cd6fa048cd962cde206b391230b50bb`; no delivery code changes.
- Bookkeeper: Codex/GPT.
- Direction panel: complete (five drafts).
- User approval: recorded for A+B at 2026-07-19 15:57:10 CST; Boundary C remains separately authorized.
- Capacity recon: **complete** — Grok Build session `019f778f-4efe-7ce0-ab37-483ed47b51c2` → `03-grok-borrow-api-capacity-recon.md` (read-only; no live authenticated calls).
- Parallel mode: enabled — disjoint backend Task A / frontend Task B with frozen API contract, R10 tails and prewritten embedded cross-review prompts.

## Capacity Recon Highlights (pointer only — read the raw report)

- Documented: `POST /papi/v1/marginLoan` single-asset; weight **100 IP**; PM pool **6000/min**.
- Observed: `maxBorrowable` consecutive used-weight Δ **~5** (sample series).
- Runtime does **not** log `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-1M`; no live headroom curve.
- Steady read papi load ≪ 6000; IP quota is unlikely the binding limit for moderate retries.
- Balance `crossMarginBorrowed` exists in raw samples but is not mapped to the snapshot and cannot uniquely attribute a loan; loan history / `tranId` remains mandatory for success.
- No production frequency chosen; 1s write loops are quota-possible but product-unproven.

## Blockers

- Task A: Kimi round-1 found a high fail-closed restart defect plus three scope-contained HTTP-contract defects. They must be repaired and re-reviewed once by Kimi before H_A commit.
- No live `marginLoan`, authenticated probe or Binance write is authorized in A+B.

## Next Action

Human operator dispatches `task-A-embedded-review-round1-fix.dispatch.md`. GLM may modify only Task A scope, must write the required fix note and rerun all backend tests, then a fresh Kimi session performs the one permitted round-2 embedded review. Task B’s verified retry-1 PASS waits unchanged for R4 reconciliation.
