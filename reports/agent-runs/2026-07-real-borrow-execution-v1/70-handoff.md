# Handoff

## Recovery Header

- Active phase: `R4 reconciled; serial delivery commits pending`
- Next action: bookkeeper creates serial H_A backend and H_B frontend commits, then re-runs full stage tests.
- Read-set: `status.current_inputs`
- Open blockers: no implementation blocker. Both embedded checkpoints PASS and R4 patch reconciliation matched; formal test/review gates remain.
- Do-not-read: `reports/agent-runs/**/history/**`, other stages

## Current State

- Stage: `2026-07-real-borrow-execution-v1`
- Status: `implementing` (Task A round-2 PASS; Task B PASS; awaiting serial code commits)
- Branch: `stage/2026-07-real-borrow-execution-v1`
- Last committed design baseline: `8ffc81b21154bdf8a6255ae68cba936fbed12a99`
- H_intake dispatch evidence commit: `90e66c3f9cd6fa048cd962cde206b391230b50bb`; no delivery code changes.
- Bookkeeper: Codex/GPT.
- Direction panel: complete (five drafts).
- User approval: recorded for A+B at 2026-07-19 15:57:10 CST; Boundary C remains separately authorized.
- Capacity recon: **complete** — Grok Build session `019f778f-4efe-7ce0-ab37-483ed47b51c2` → `03-grok-borrow-api-capacity-recon.md` (read-only; no live authenticated calls).
- Parallel mode: enabled — disjoint backend Task A / frontend Task B with frozen API contract, R10 tails and prewritten embedded cross-review prompts.

## Capacity Recon Highlights (pointer only — read the raw report)

- Documented: `POST /papi/v1/marginLoan` single-asset; weight **100 IP**; PM pool **6000/min**.
- Observed: `maxBorrowable` consecutive used-weight Δ **~5** (sample series).
- Runtime does **not** log `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-1M`; no live headroom curve.
- Steady read papi load ≪ 6000; IP quota is unlikely the binding limit for moderate retries.
- Balance `crossMarginBorrowed` exists in raw samples but is not mapped to the snapshot and cannot uniquely attribute a loan; loan history / `tranId` remains mandatory for success.
- No production frequency chosen; 1s write loops are quota-possible but product-unproven.

## Blockers

- No live `marginLoan`, authenticated probe or Binance write is authorized in A+B.

## Next Action

Bookkeeper performs serial H_A/H_B commits after the matching R4 evidence, re-runs canonical backend/frontend stage tests, computes the committed fingerprint, and then prepares formal task-scoped Review-1 dispatches.
